# Phase 1

## Request the new license book

Ask Ulrike to create the new license book. When received, put it to [`distro/license-book`](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/distro/license-book) folder.

## Prepare test plan

Set a meeting with QA to prepare a test plan for the manual testing of the release:
1. Pick which features to test by looking at the [Confluence Roadmap list](https://app.camunda.com/confluence/display/camBPM/Roadmap+Camunda+BPM)
2. Create a (Google/Airtable) spreadsheet to be used for keeping track of the testing process (you can use [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D9XF5Y84qeB-uFGOo8tnDbXHPJx-aNzsTpWprdfIpiI/edit?usp=sharing) as a template)
  * The spreadsheet should include all the features that need to be tested, feature documentation and implementer name
  * The spreadsheet should include all the possible variations for a testing environment setup (App Server + DB + JDK + OS + Browser)
3. Check if there are any new supported environments (ex. new Database Versions) and if they are available for testing through [Portainer](https://hq2.camunda.com/portainer/#/templates/).
  - If there is an environment missing, ask SRE to provide it.

## Adjust and migrate Getting Started guides
      
Follow the procedure here:
https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-dev-docs/blob/master/releases/Getting-started-guides.md

Keep in mind that the platform version in the `pom.xml` files should be adjusted only for testing. Only commit changes that are needed for the Guides to be functional. The platform version will be permanently adjusted through a Jenkins job at a later phase of the Release process.

## Adjust and migrate Examples

Test and adjust the existing Camunda BPM Examples for the new minor release. Do the following steps for this.

* Clone the Git Repository https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples
* Create a new branch for the minor release (ex. 7.12) to push all the changes to the branch and merge it to master when the new minor release exists. This allow to have the examples runnable until the release is finished.
* Adjust the `camunda-version` in the Maven `pom.xml` of the current example
* Follow the README of the current example to test it
* Adjust the links of the README to point to the new version of the docs (ex.: `https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.12`)
* Push the changes to the master/minor release branch
* Do the steps before for all examples
* Squash all the commits and merge the release branch to master
* Add a new (7.X) tag to the overview [README](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-examples/blob/master/README.md)
* Create the 7.X tag for the minor release version on the squashed commit
* Push the changes to master

### Changes to the `Java` source files in the examples
Make sure the files contain a valid license header.

## Adjust and migrate unit testing template

Bump the Camunda version in https://github.com/camunda/camunda-engine-unittest

## Write Update Guide

Document the steps which are necessary to update from Camunda BPM 7.11.x to 7.12.0 for the different application server.

* Go into the cloned Git repository `camunda-docs-manual`
* Create a new folder `711-to-712` under `content/minor`
* Describe the different steps for the current application server in an own file.

## Stage the blog post

#### 1. Update the 'master' and create a branch 7.12.0 on the [blog repository](https://github.com/camunda/blog.camunda.org).

```
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git checkout -b 7.12.0
```

#### 2. Create a file 'camunda-bpm-7120-released.md' at /content/post/2019/11/ and push it to the repo.

```
git add /content/post/2019/11/camunda-bpm-7120-released.md
git commit
git push origin 7.12.0
```

#### 3. Ask TL to write the blog post.

## Release all secondary Camunda projects

1. Check the [bom](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/bom/pom.xml#L34-L43), if there are secondary projects with an alpha/snapshot version.
2. If that's the case we need to release them. Follow this [procedure](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/wiki/Release-secondary-projects)

**Hint:**
When releasing a secondary project, other secondary projects might have cross-references to it and you should update them accordingly. E.g., for camunda-commons you need to update the `pom.xml` files of the following projects as well:
* dmn-engine
* spin
* connect
* engine

## Update the Entity Relationship Diagrams

1. Go to the [database upgrade scripts](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/engine/src/main/resources/org/camunda/bpm/engine/db/create) and check what changed in the database structure.
2. Create ERDs for the new version by copying the last version ERDs (ex. erd-bpmn_7.12.mwb from a copy of erd-bpmn_7.12.mwb). Then update the new ERDs accordingly.
  * The ERD files can be found in the camunda-docs-manual repo [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs-manual/tree/master/content/user-guide/process-engine/erd-project).
  * They can be edited through the [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) tool.
  * After they are edited, generate the appropriate `.SVG` images for each ERD and put them in the `img` directory [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs-manual/tree/master/content/user-guide/process-engine/img). Ex. for `erd-bpmn_7.12.mwb` there should be a `erd_712_bpmn.svg` image.
  * Finally, update the image links in the [database.md page|https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs-manual/blob/master/content/user-guide/process-engine/database.md]
3. Check if everything looks good after you make the adjustments in the [documentation](https://stage.docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-engine/database/#entity-relationship-diagrams).

-----

# Phase 2

## Check Preconditions

- There are no Snapshot dependencies to secondary projects like Spin Connect (check [bom](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/bom/pom.xml) for snapshot dependencies)
- There are no code problems ([check ci](https://hq2.camunda.com/broken) section "master")
- [Release Test Job](https://release.cambpm.camunda.cloud/view/Release-Test/) passed successfully recently
- There are no code tickets in review or test
- Send an email to camundabpm@camunda.com:
```
Hey,

please stop pushing to master since we are going to build the 7.x release.
```
*Keep in mind that staged artifacts are kept up to 6 days, arrange the build no more than 6 days before the official release.

## Trigger the Release Build

Open the following URL in Jenkins:
https://release.cambpm.camunda.cloud/view/Release-Master/

Set correct versions, select Release Type = "Final" and click on the "Run" icon.

Wait for the following jobs to turn green before continuing with the next step:
* 7.X-RELEASE-build-camunda-bpm-tags
* 7.X-RELEASE-build-EE-nightly-tags

## Test Release

Let the team and QA test the release. Share the test plan spreadsheet with the team. If everything is satisfying with the release, send an email to camundabpm@camunda.com:

```
Hey,

the release test passed, you can commit to master again :)

```

## Test standalone webapps

You have to download the CE standalone webapps
([`camunda-webapp-SERVER-standalone-VERSION.war`](https://camunda.org/release/camunda-bpm/))
and the EE standalone webapps
([`camunda-webapp-ee-SERVER-standalone-VERSION-ee.war`](https://camunda.org/enterprise-release/camunda-bpm/)).

**Note:** There is no separate standalone webapp for wildfly, use the jboss one
for testing.

To test the standalone webapp you need a vanilla version of the application
servers (without camunda installed). You can download the vanilla distros
from our nexus:

- [Tomcat](https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/apache/tomcat/tomcat/)
- [JBoss](https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/jboss/as/jboss-as-dist/)
- [Widlfly](https://app.camunda.com/nexus/content/groups/public/org/wildfly/wildfly-dist/)

The versions to use can be found in the current [parent
pom.xml](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/parent/pom.xml#L31-L37).

To test websphere and weblogic I would suggest to ask SRE to spin up a docker image in the HQ for testing. An
alternative would be the developer VM.

To deploy the standalone webapp follow the [installation
guide](http://stage.docs.camunda.org/manual/develop/installation/standalone-webapplication/#deploy). Normally
you have to copy the war file to the corresponding webapps folder of the
application server or use the web console for websphere and weblogic.

You can configure the process engine and database by editing the
`WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` in the war file, if you want to test something
special.

After starting the standalone webapp test the webapps by starting some
processes, completing task, adding users and so one. Also focus on new
features introduced in the upcoming release.

**Note:** The job executor is disabled in the standalone webapps, which means
no jobs will be executed. So for example batches will not be executed either.

After finishing the test compare the process engine configuration in
`WEB-INF/applicationContext.xml` of the war file with the configuration
of the process engine shipped with the distribution. In general the engines
should be configure identical.

## Stage new version of the docs

### Create new Manual Branch

First a new branch needs to be created in the camunda-docs-manual repository

```sh
git checkout -b 7.12
```

### Adjust config on branch

On the new branch, adjust the configuration. Open the file `config.yaml` with an editor and edit it as follows:

```

Test the changes by running

```sh
hugo server -w
```

and opening http://localhost:1313/manual/7.12/ in the browser.

Commit changes and push the branch:

```sh
git commit -a -m "chore(release): create 7.12 branch"
git push origin 7.12
```

## Create docs stage and release jobs for new branch

Ask SRE to perform the following:

Clone the camunda-ci/jenkins-job-dsl-seed-jobs repository and go into it.

Now you need to create new jobs for staging and releasing the new docs branch.

This is easily be done by adding the new maintenance version to the [Versions.groovy](https://github.com/camunda-ci/jenkins-job-dsl-seed-jobs/blob/master/src/main/groovy/version/Versions.groovy) file.

Commit and push the changes

```sh
git commit -a -m "chore(release): create 7.12 docs jobs"
git push origin master
```

After drinking 1 espresso, the new jobs should now appear on https://ci.cambpm.camunda.cloud/view/Docs/

Trigger `camunda-docs-manual-stage (7.12, 7.12)` and check the result at http://stage.docs.camunda.org/manual/7.12/

## Adjust docs with new verstion (*)

### Release new docs version as latest (*)

You also need to release the new version as "latest".

Checkout the latest branch of the camunda-docs-manual repository and set to new version

```sh
git checkout latest
git reset 7.12 --hard
```

Next, adjust the configuration for the latest version

Commit and force-push

```sh
git commit -a -m "chore(release): release 7.12 as latest"
git push origin latest --force
```

### Add new version of the manual to all other versions (*)

Next we need to make sure the user can select the new version in the version select boxes on all other branches.
This procedure is different for hugo and docpad based branches.
For hugo based branches (master, 7.4+) this means:

### Adjust Redirects / URL rewrites

Next we need to adjust the URL rewrites. Please note the examples are given with 7.11 release version and 7.12 next development. First for stage. Go into the repository `camunda-docs-static`:

```diff

```

Commit & push to master

```sh
git commit -a -m "chore(release): set next javadocs redirect"
git push origin master
```

This is all that needs to be done for stage. For live we need to set the new version as the default "stable version". However, we should not commit and push this directly to master since it will become visible right away. Instead we prepare a pull request:

```sh
git checkout -b 7.12

```

commit and push to branch:

```sh
git commit -am "chore(release): set 7.12 as default version"
git push origin 7.12
```

Merge this branch into master on the release day.

Hint: Essentially, you need to replace all the occurrences of the string `7.11` with `7.12`.

#### Update the documentation smoke tests

We also need to [adjust the smoke tests](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-docs-static/blob/master/test/HttpRedirectionTest.yml) for the URL rewrites that we adjusted before. Please note the examples are given with 7.11 release version and 7.12 next development.

```diff

    status: 307
```

Commit the changes to the release branch and merge this branch into master on the release day:

```sh
git commit -am "chore(release): update smoke tests to version 7.12"
git push origin 7.12
```

Hint: As mentioned before, you need to replace all the occurrences of the string `7.11` with `7.12`.

# Phase 3

## Release Jira

Talk to EM or TL.

## Forward Security Reports

Determine all security reports for which fixes have are released and forward them to 1) TL 2) EM. They will then take care of publishing security notices. Find all such issues with the following JIRA query:

```
project = CAM AND fixVersion = <released version> AND type = "Security Report"
```

## Add new Version to Delivery Manager

Select the **Versions** tab on the [Delivery Manager](https://delivery-manager.camunda.com/delivery-manager/) dashboard. Add the latest version to the list of versions.

## Release Maven Central

We have several CI jobs which upload artifacts to Maven Central into their staging repository section. In order to make them publicly available, we need to manually close the staging repositories and release the artifacts.

1. Go to [Maven Central](https://oss.sonatype.org/) and login using the credentials found in our [Confluence](https://app.camunda.com/confluence/display/camBPM/Maven+Central+Release)
2. On the left side, click on the 'Staging Repositories' link.
3. After it has been loaded, scroll down to the bottom of the list. You should find the relevant Camunda staging repositories there.
4. Mark each repository you want to release.
    
    *For Example:*  

    >org.camunda.bpm:camunda-bom:7.12.0  
    >org.camunda.bpm.webapp:camunda-webapp:7.12.0  
    >org.camunda.bpm.model:camunda-bpmn-model:7.12.0  
    >org.camunda.bpm.model:camunda-dmn-model:7.12.0  
    >org.camunda.bpm.model:camunda-cmmn-model:7.12.0  
    >org.camunda.bpm.dmn:camunda-engine-dmn-bom:7.12.0  
    >org.camunda.bpm.model:camunda-xml-model:7.12.0

5. Click on 'Release' at the menu on top of the list. A window will pop up were you can enter a description but it is not necessary. Activate 'Drop repository after release automatically'. Then proceed.
6. Done.

## Release Javadocs

1. The javadocs are staged automatically by the release build. Checkout if the javadocs are available at http://stage.docs.camunda.org/javadoc/camunda-bpm-platform/7.12 (you need to adapt the version in the link to the release version).
2. Verify that the correct javadocs are present.
3. Go to [Jenkins Camunda Docs Jobs](https://ci.cambpm.camunda.cloud/view/Docs/). After that, release the javadocs by triggering the the job `camunda-docs-release (javadoc-camunda-bpm-platform-7.12)` and `camunda-docs-release (javadoc-camunda-bpm-platform-7.13-SNAPSHOT)` (adapt versions).

# Phase 4

* time: when the artifacts are built

## Camunda BPM Platform code changes

* time: when the [jobs](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/wiki/Perfoming-a-Minor-Release#ci-tasks) below are ready

### Update "old version" in maven

Update the `camunda.version.old` property in:
* camunda-bpm-platform:
  * [database pom][database-pom]
  * [qa/create new engine (here: `version.previous`)](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/qa/test-db-rolling-update/create-new-engine/pom.xml)
  * [ qa/test-db-upgrade](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/qa/test-db-upgrade/pom.xml)
* [camunda-engine-dmn][engine-dmn-pom]
* [camunda-bpmn-model][bpmn-model-pom]
* [camunda-cmmn-model][cmmn-model-pom]
* [camunda-dmn-model][dmn-model-pom]
* [camunda-xml-model][xml-model-pom]

to the previous minor version.

If the minor release includes a new commons release, update the `version.old` properties in [camunda/camunda-commons][typed-values-pom].  
If the minor release includes a new spin release, update the `spin.version.old` properties in [camunda/camunda-spin][spin-pom].  
If the minor release includes a new connect release, update the `connect.version.old` properties in [camunda/camunda-connect][connect-pom].

Update the `camunda.version` property in:

* camunda-bpm-platform:
  * [qa/test-db-rolling-update/create-old-engine](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/qa/test-db-rolling-update/create-old-engine/pom.xml)
  * [qa/test-db-rolling-update/rolling-update-util](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/qa/test-db-rolling-update/rolling-update-util/pom.xml)
  * [qa/test-db-rolling-update/test-old-engine](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/qa/test-db-rolling-update/test-old-engine/pom.xml)
  * [ qa/test-old-engine/](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/master/qa/test-old-engine/pom.xml)


Update test fixture:
  * add ``qa/test-db-instance-migration/test-fixture-XX/pom.xml`` and replace ``XX`` with new version
  * add the new module to [qa/test-db-instance-migration/pom.xml](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/blob/cb86cadd332cd97b486c9c8efe7420110000764c/qa/test-db-instance-migration/pom.xml):
```diff
     <module>test-fixture-712</module>
+    <module>test-fixture-713</module>
     <module>test-migration</module>
```

### Add instance migration project

When the new version is 7.x, a new instance migration project that performs upgrade logic from 7.(x-1) to 7.(x) has to be added. Perform the following steps:

* In the [instance-migration project][instance-migration] and its most recent `test-fixture` project, set the property `camunda.version.current` to `7.(x-1).0`
* Add a new module called `test-fixture-7(x)`
* Configure the new module such that it executes patch scripts and upgrade scripts from `7.(x-1).0` to `7.(x).0-SNAPSHOT` (take a look at other `test-fixture` projects)
* Add the module to the [instance migration pom][instance-migration-pom]

### Create upgrade scripts

In the [sql-scripts][sql-scripts] folder of the [camunda/camunda-bpm-platform][camunda-bpm-platform]:

1. Create an empty upgrade script for each supported database following the naming pattern ```${database}_engine_${previousVersion}_to_${currentVersion}```.
2. Follow this [SQL Development Guide](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/wiki/SQL-and-DDL-Management#development-1) to set the initial content of the new scripts.

## CI tasks

Create an issue for SRE to provide support for the new minor version. Following [steps](https://github.com/camunda-ci/jenkins-job-dsl-seed-jobs/blob/master/docs/NewCamBPMVersion.md) have to be completed.
  * A new (7.X) branch needs to be created on the maintenance repo through the https://release.cambpm.camunda.cloud/job/maintenance/job/RELEASE-create-camunda-bpm-maintenance-branch/ job
