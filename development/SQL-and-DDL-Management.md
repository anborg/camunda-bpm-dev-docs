The following sections describe how we handle the development of SQL scripts and their adjustments, including patch level fixes.
After reading this guide, the developer will have some knowledge about what is required to write the different SQL scripts, where they are located and how they are tested.   

# General Rules

* Use standard SQL when writing the SQL whenever possible. Use of database-specific functions can be necessary sometimes, but it is **NOT** recommended.

# Create and Drop Scripts

The Camunda Engine uses SQL databases as storage backend so it is necessary to develop the data definition language (DDL) for each supported database type like DB2 etc.

## Development
The `create` and `drop` scripts contain all necessary logic to create the required schema for the Engine and Identity mechanism. This includes the creation and deletion of tables, foreign keys and indexes.

All `create` scripts must update the `ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG` table by adding a new entry. `insert into ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG values ('0', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '<schema-version>');` Replace `<schema-version>` with the current version of the engine.

## Naming
The naming convention for creating a `create`/`drop` script is:

```
activiti.${database_type}.${action}.${purpose}.sql
```

where `${database_type}` the database identifier like db2, h2, etc. `${action}` specifies whether this script creates or drops the database
scheme. The `${purpose}` describes which database scheme is
managed by this script. For example `engine` as purpose denotes the creation
of the necessary runtime engine tables.

A complete naming example for a create script:
`activiti.db2.create.engine.sql`, for a drop script:
`activiti.mssql.drop.history.sql`.

## Testing
The `create` and `drop` scripts are tested using the Engine [testsuite](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/engine/src/test/). The test suite is executed against all supported databases.
During the tests, the scripts are executed through the engine to create the necessary tables before testing and dropping them afterward.

## Location
The existing `create` and `drop` scripts for the Engine can be found [here].

# Upgrade Scripts

Camunda BPM as Open Source project provides SQL upgrade scripts for all supported databases to migrate between minor versions.
These scripts contain all necessary schema changes to upgrade the existing schema of the previous minor version to the following minor version.

## Development
The `upgrade` scripts contain all necessary logic to create the required schema for the Engine and Identity mechanism. This includes the creation and deletion of tables, foreign keys, and indexes.

All `upgrade` scripts must update the `ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG` table by adding a new entry. `insert into ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG values ('<next-id>', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '<schema-version>');` Replace `<schema-version>` with the current version of the engine and `<next-id>` with the id of the previous entry incremented by 100. This ensures there is enough space for changes introduced with patches.

## Naming
Other than for the `create`/`drop` scripts the naming of `upgrade` scripts must strictly follow a rule. This is because the file names are parsed to determine the latest database schema version. The naming rule for creating an `upgrade` script is:

```
${database_type}_${purpose}_${old_minor_version}_to_${new_minor_version}.sql
```

where `${purpose}` in this case denotes what is affected when you execute the script. Currently, the only value for `${purpose}` is `engine`. 
The placeholders `${old_minor_version}` and `${new_minor_version}` describe the minor versions.  

Example: `db2_engine_7.2_to_7.3.sql` or `mysql_engine_7.1_to_7.2.sql`.

# Maintaining Backwards Compatibility

See Section on [Backwards Compatibility](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/wiki/Backwards-Compatibility)

## Testing
The upgrade scripts are tested using the [database upgrade](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-platform/tree/master/qa/test-db-upgrade) project.
During the execution of the project these things are done:

1. Creation of the database tables with the create scripts of the previously released minor version. Eg. the database `create` scripts of 7.2.0.
2. The schema will then be patched by applying all released patch scripts for the previously released minor version.
3. Then the upgrade scripts will be applied to the schema. This migrates the schema to the next minor version, eg. 7.3.0.
4. Afterward, all available patch scripts for the newest minor version will be applied, except those which are already present in the previous minor version. 
This situation happens when the same SQL patch script is available for eg. 7.2 and 7.3 minor versions.
5. Then the engine test suite of the current minor version is run against the migrated and patched database schema.
6. At last the database schema is dropped by using the database drop scripts from the current minor version.

# Providing Patches

When our customers or community users discover SQL schema related problems during a minor version, we create so-called SQL patch level scripts.
These scripts apply the necessary fixes for the bug, nothing more. `Patch-level` and `upgrade` scripts have **no intersection**, meaning they do not contain the same statement/s.
They are released in a patch level version for a specific minor version.

## Development
To create a patch level script, follow these guidelines:

1. Identify which database and Camunda BPM patch versions are affected.

2. Following the [naming rule](ref:#sql-scripts-patch-sql-scripts-naming-convention)
    1. Create the corresponding patch scripts with the fix for each affected minor version branch. Start by creating them on `master` in the `upgrade`-folder of the distribution located [here].
If `master` is affected too, the patch for it will be done in the `create` and `drop` scripts only. Because it is not yet released, database changes are not done in a patch script.
    2. Add the fix to the `create` and `drop` scripts of each affected database on each minor version branch, except `master` where it is already done through the `create` scripts.
    3. Make sure you have added **all** patch scripts for **all** versions on master in the `upgrade`-folder. On **each** minor version branch, only patch scripts are added which **belong to the version of the minor branch and previously released minor versions**.
E.g., on `master`, all patch scripts are available. On `7.2`, only patch scripts affecting `7.2` and lower minor versions are available, i.e., `7.1` and `7.0`. On `7.1`, only patch scripts regarding `7.1` and lower are available.
    4. For each `patch` script it is necessary to update the table `ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG` by adding a new entry. `insert into ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG values ('<next-id>', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, '<target-schema-version>');` Replace `<next-id>` with the id of the last entry incremented by 1. Also replace `<target-schema-version>` with the target version of the `upgrade` script.

3. To get the testing right, some modifications must be done to the `patch-new-schema` section of the `sql-maven-plugin` and the `generate-test-resources` phase configuration of the `maven-antrun-plugin` in the [database upgrade] and [instance migration] tests.
    1. Regarding the `maven-antrun-plugin`, it is necessary to add a `touch` command for the patch script of the branch you are currently working on. This action generates a `dummy` patch file during testing for databases where no patch is required.
    2. The `sql-maven-plugin` is responsible for creating the old schema of the previous minor version, patching the old schema, upgrading to the new minor version, patching the new minor version and finally dropping the schema after the tests.
**BUT** you only have to do a manual modification if the bug is not also
present in the previous minor version. If the bug is present in the previous
minor version it is automatically applied in the `patch-old-schema` execution
of the `pom.xml`. If this is not the case you have to add it manually to the
`patch-new-schema` execution of the `pom.xml`.

4. Document the new patch level scripts by adding them to the list of [available SQL Patch scripts](ref:/guides/migration-guide/#patch-level-upgrade-upgrade-your-database-available-sql-patch-scripts) in the migration guide.
Describe for each patch script file: Affected Camunda BPM minor version, the full name of the patch file, a description what it fixes, the affected databases and a link to the concrete CAM issue in our issue tracker.
If the **same** fix is in multiple patch scripts, e.g., on different branches, then also **mention** those patch scripts. This is **important**, so the users know that they may have already applied the fix through another patch script from a previous minor version branch.


## Complete example for creating a patch level script

The context:
* Camunda BPM minor version `7.1` and `7.2` are affected. Also the currently developed version `7.3` (i.e., the `master` branch)

Steps:
1. Identify the affected database and Camunda BPM minor versions:

    1. Affected database is `db2`
    2. Affected versions are `7.1.9`, `7.2.4` and `7.3.0-SNAPSHOT`

2. Creation of the corresponding patch scripts for each affected branch:
    1. For `7.2`, create the patch file `db2_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql`. For `7.1`, create the patch file `db2_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql`.
Put all created patch scripts into the `upgrade`-folder on `master`.
Since `master` is also affected, the fix for it has to be done in the `activiti.db2.create.engine.sql` and `activiti.db2.drop.engine.sql` scripts.
    2. Add fix to the `activiti.db2.create.engine.sql` and `activiti.db2.drop.engine.sql` on `master`, `7.2` and `7.1` branches.
    3. Add update of `ACT_GE_SCHEMA_LOG` by adding a new entry with incremented id and script specific target version. In this case, the target versions would be `7.1.10` and `7.2.5`
    4. Overview of the new files on each affected branch in the `upgrade`-folder:
`master`'s `upgrade`-folder now looks like this:
```
upgrade
  |-- db2_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql
  |-- db2_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql
```
On `7.2`, add the `db2_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql` and `db2_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql` patch scripts. The `upgrade`-folder should now look like this:
```
upgrade
  |-- db2_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql
  |-- db2_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql
```
On `7.1`, only the `db2_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql` patch script is added. The `upgrade`-folder looks like this:
```
upgrade
  |-- db2_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql
```
3. The following lines need to be added to the `pom.xml` of [database upgrade] and [instance migration] tests. For each test project, add the lines to the `maven-antrun-plugin` and `sql-maven-plugin`.
On `master` and `7.2` nothing is added, because the patches of the previous minor version are applied automatically. On `7.1`, the patch scripts for `7.1` must be added to the `patch-new-schema` section.
This must be done because the `7.0` minor version doesn't apply the patch script as an old version like it is happening on `master` and `7.2`.
For 7.1:
```
...
<artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
...
  <target>
  ...
  <!-- patches for current minor version if any -->
  ...
  <!-- NEWLY ADDED FILES -->
  <touch
    file="${project.build.directory}/scripts-current/sql/upgrade/${database.type}_engine_${camunda.current.majorVersion}.${camunda.current.minorVersion}_patch_${camunda.current.majorVersion}.${camunda.current.minorVersion}.9_to_${camunda.current.majorVersion}.${camunda.current.minorVersion}.10.sql" />
  </target>
```
```
...
<artifactId>sql-maven-plugin</artifactId>
<executions>
...
  <execution>
    <id>patch-new-schema</id>
    ...
    <configuration>
      <srcFiles>
      ...
        <!-- NEWLY ADDED FILES -->
        <srcFile>${project.build.directory}/scripts-current/sql/upgrade/${database.type}_engine_${camunda.current.majorVersion}.${camunda.current.minorVersion}_patch_${camunda.current.majorVersion}.${camunda.current.minorVersion}.9_to_${camunda.current.majorVersion}.${camunda.current.minorVersion}.10.sql</srcFile>
      </srcFiles>
    </configuration>
  </execution>
...
```

4. Add notes on the patch scripts to the list of [available SQL Patch scripts](ref:/guides/migration-guide/#patch-level-upgrade-upgrade-your-database-available-sql-patch-scripts).

For the patch script fixing 7.1.9, following values are added:

  * affected Camunda BPM minor version: `7.1`
  * patch filename:	`$DATABASE_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql`
  * description: Add a missing index on foreign key to prevent deadlocks. This is the same patch as `$DATABASE_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql`.
  * Affected databases: `DB2`
  * Issue: `CAM-3565`

For the patch script fixing 7.2.4, following values are added:

  * affected Camunda BPM minor version: `7.2`
  * patch filename:	`$DATABASE_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql`
  * description: Add a missing index on foreign key to prevent deadlocks. This is the same patch as `$DATABASE_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql`.
  * Affected databases: `DB2`
  * Issue: `CAM-3565`


## Naming
As with `upgrade` scripts the naming rule for `patch` scripts must strictly be followed. This is because the file names are parsed to determine the latest database schema version. The naming rule for creating an `upgrade` script is:

```
${database_type}_${purpose}_${minor_version}_patch_${patch_version_with_bug}_to_${fix_patch_version}.sql
```

where

  * `${database_type}` describes the affected database, e.g., `db2`, `mysql` and so on. The placeholder `${purpose}` denotes what is affected when you execute the script. Currently, the only value for `${purpose}` is `engine`. 
  * `${minor version}` is the version of the current branch you are on, e.g., it is `7.2` on `7.2` branch.
  * `${patch_version_with_bug}` describes the patch level version affected by the bug and `${fix_patch_version}` describes the fix patch version.

Example: `db2_engine_7.2_patch_7.2.4_to_7.2.5.sql` or `mssql_engine_7.1_patch_7.1.9_to_7.1.10.sql`

## Testing
The patch level scripts are tested using the same mechanism as the [upgrade](ref:/guides/developer-guide/#sql-scripts-upgrade-sql-scripts-testing) scripts.
