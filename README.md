# camunda-bpm-dev-docs

Developer documentation for Camunda BPM, created by the Camunda Runtime development team. 

## Please note:

* This guide is maintained by the Camunda Runtime development team for primarily internal purposes.
* We have decided to make it public, because some articles and pieces of knowledge may be relevant for anyone interested in Camunda internals. That said, we will not be able to clarify questions around its content and will most likely not be able to handle contributions in any form.
* It is NOT part of the official Camunda documentation and therefore doesn't provide any guarantees of quality. Content may be outdated, incorrect or hard to understand.
